                                between different components of the network. This lack of standardization leads manufacturers
                                to employ their own proprietary protocols in their products. Consequently, components from
                                different manufacturers are unable to communicate effectively. This issue is rather serious as
                                it prevents the mixing and matching of BBUs and RRUs, thereby undermining the effectiveness of

Radio Unit(RU), Distributed Unit(DU), and Centralized Unit(CU). In this architecture, the DU
and CU are software components that run on servers, while the RU consists of the radio
hardware responsible for transmitting and receiving signals. Each option for splitting up
        functions into these components has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the suitability
        of each can vary depending on specific environmental needs. Notebly, the splits option 7.2, is
        the one chosen by the O-RAN Alliances, thus becoming a popular choice within the industry.</span> <h2 id="A-Bridge-from-O-RAN-to-its-security-concern-and-into-PTP" data-id="A-Bridge-from-O-RAN-to-its-security-concern-and-into-PTP" data-svelte-h="svelte-1pl2701"><span>A Bridge from O-RAN to its security concern, and into PTP.</span></h2> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1jzrunp">Now that we understand the structure of O-RAN and 5G, there&#39;s still one important aspect to

                   The security concern about the O-RAN architecture is of upmost importance and one of the major hurdle we need to
                   overcome on the road of 5G. <br>
                   This problem is multifaceted and complex.

                           Protocol(PTP) comes into play. PTP enables accurate time synchronization throughout a computer

           It&#39;s clear that even a minor discrepancy in timing can result in substantial financial losses.
           For instance, if the trading computer and your own computer are not synchronized, purchasing
           stocks at the wrong moment could lead to disparities in stock prices and significant financial
           losses. This underscores the necessity for precise time alignment and low latency within a

                           devices. By employing the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA), a PTP network determines the
                           hierarchy of clocks in the network. It removes redundant connections and organizes the entire
                           network into a hierarchical structure resembling &quot;a tree.&quot; This simplifies time
                           synchronization, as circular configurations are avoided. Within such a network, a single
                           device is designated as the grandmaster (GM), responsible for controlling precise time. Other
                           devices receive time messages from the GM.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-gmz207">Through the exchange of several messages among the clocks in all devices, the entire network

                                masters, slaves, only-slaves, and the grandmaster. These
                                classifications are not static, as a clock&#39;s role may change depending on its interconnections

                                the time reference, while the slave clock receives time messages from its master. A slave-only
                                clock continuously functions as a slave clock, being as a leaf of a tree. Conversely, the

                                            latency may increase and time accuracy may decrease. BC addresses this issue by incorporating

        used for time synchronization.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1t0ia4o">Firstly, we need to understand the terms &quot;Offset&quot; and &quot;Delay&quot; in the synchronization process.
        &quot;Offset&quot; refers to the time difference between the master and slave clock, while &quot;Delay&quot;
            represents the time needed to transfer packets from the master to the slave.</span> <span>In the time exchange process, the master clock initially sends a sync message and records the
            actual time this message is sent ( <span style="display: none;">T_1</span>  <span></span>). Then, the master clock sends out a follow_up message to convey </span><span data-svelte-h="svelte-1yzrim5">. This procedure is required because sync message alone cannot accurately record the time
                when it is sent. The slave clock then records both
                </span><span>(from the follow_up message) and the time it receives the sync message ( <span style="display: none;">T_2</span>  <span></span>). At this point, the slave clock becomes aware of the time difference between itself and its
                master. However, it cannot adjust its time yet because it doesn&#39;t know the duration it takes
                for a message to travel from the master to the slave clock.</span> <span>Upon receiving the follow-up message from the master, the slave subsequently sends a
                delay_request message and records the time as  <span style="display: none;">\,T_3</span>  <span></span> </span><span data-svelte-h="svelte-142fzk2">. The master clock immideately replies with a delay_response message, including the
