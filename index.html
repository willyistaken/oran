		<span data-svelte-h="svelte-zrmrcp">The fifth-generation technology standard for cellular networks, commonly referred to as 5G,
			represents the latest advancement in telecommunications. Deployments of 5G began in 2019,
			heralding a new era with its promise of high speed and low latency. But what makes 5G so
			important? What&#39;s all the buzz about? To answer these questions, we need to take a detour and
			delve into the history of RAN.</span> <h3 id="The-history-of-RAN" data-id="The-history-of-RAN" data-svelte-h="svelte-1jjo8v5"><span>The history of RAN</span></h3> <h4 id="0G" data-id="0G" data-svelte-h="svelte-1dixglh"><span>0G</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lha4ni">After World War II, wireless telephones became available to the general public. The era
			before cellular networks is often referred to as 0G, marked the advent of commercial wireless
			communication. Unlike earlier closed telephone systems, 0G represented a significant
			advancement as it was accessible as a commercial service. These early wireless phones were

			in telecommunications.</span> <center data-svelte-h="svelte-vp4gyw"><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Car Phones (Picture from WikiPedia)"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Motorola_4500X.jpg/1200px-Motorola_4500X.jpg" width="600px"></span></center> <h4 id="1G" data-id="1G" data-svelte-h="svelte-1ndhrgc"><span>1G</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-17ed5wu">This marks the advent of the first generation of cellular network, commercially deployed in
			1979 by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph in Tokyo. This network utilized the cellular structure
			mentioned earlier and introduced the capability of automatic switching between different base
			stations. However, it relied on analog signals to transmit and receive information, making it
			susceptible to noise and distortion.</span> <h4 id="2G" data-id="2G" data-svelte-h="svelte-rgjnuz"><span>2G</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1cjlvfa">One major difference between 2G and 1G is that 2G transmits signals using digital signals,
			marking the first generation to do so. Additionally, some 2G systems began to support
			SMS(Short Message Service) and simple data transmission. However, 2G is now being phased out
			due to its comparatively low speed and transmission rate.</span> <h4 id="3G" data-id="3G" data-svelte-h="svelte-8cxlne"><span>3G</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-pv4cop">3G is characterized by its ability to support high-speed mobile data, typically in the range
			of a few hundred kilobits per second (kbps). 3G also aims to provide standardized Internet
			communication protocols, enabling users to browse the Internet and access various data from
			anywhere in the world. Moreover, 3G combines wireless communication with the Internet,
			creating a new system capable of handling images, music, video, and web browsing, which forms
			the foundation of the modern mobile network we are familiar with today. It uses a new
			technique called CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) to efficiently package data for
			transmission.</span>
	
	&lt;pic&gt;<span data-svelte-h="svelte-134jxm">animation of CDMA</span>&lt;/pic&gt;
	<h4 id="4G" data-id="4G" data-svelte-h="svelte-1hwuek1"><span>4G</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-mt5e9e">4G represents a significant advancement over 3G, offering speeds up to 10 times faster than
			its predecessor. It achieves this leap in performance by using Orthogonal Frequency Division
			Multiple Access(OFDMA) technology. OFDMA effectively turns high-speed signals into multiple
			parallel lower-speed signals, thereby enhancing the efficiency of frequency spectrum
			utilization and increasing data transmission rates. This technological innovation enables
			smoother and faster mobile internet experiences, catering to the growing demand for high-speed
			data services.</span>

	<h4 id="5G" data-id="5G" data-svelte-h="svelte-1w0vwt4"><span>5G</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-n2mct1">Finally, we arrive at 5G, the newest generation of cellular technology.</span><br> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-hohpz4">In recent years, the internet and our daily lives have become more entangled than ever
			before. Devices such as autonomous vehicles and various IOT appliances hold the promise of
			changing our lives for the better. However, as the quantity of such devices increases, the
			latency and speed limitations of 4G are proving to be insufficient. Therefore, the primary
			focus of 5G is to provide even faster and lower latency mobile data services.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-k0tzij">One of the main differences between 5G and 4G is the C-RAN architecture, which stands for
			Centralized RAN. The concept behind C-RAN is to separate the BBU from the RRU in a base
			station, allowing the BBU to be shared among multiple RRUs. This is in contrast to the D-RAN
			(Distributed RAN) used in previous generations, where the RRU and BBU are bundled together at
			the cell site.</span>
	
	&lt;pic&gt;<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1xnel7q">C-RAN vs D-RAN</span>&lt;/pic&gt;
	
		<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lm8bas">By using C-RAN, 5G can lower costs and increase efficiency by pooling all of the BBU
			resources. Additionally, C-RAN enables the running of BBUs as virtualized software on existing
			cloud computing services, a concept known as V-RAN(Virtualized RAN). Moreover, machine
			learning algorithms are utilized to dynamically allocate resources to different RRUs based on
			internet traffic patterns, a process facilitated by the RAN Intelligent Controller(RIC).</span>

			fundamental challenge in the actual implementation of these ideas arises: vendor lock-in.</span>
	
	&lt;meme&gt;&lt;/meme&gt;
	<h3 id="Vendor-Lock-In" data-id="Vendor-Lock-In" data-svelte-h="svelte-13phsx7"><span>Vendor Lock-In</span></h3> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1ymeh9b">Vendor lock-in occurs due to poorly defined and unstandardized communication protocols
			between different components of the network. This lack of standardization leads manufacturers
			to employ their own proprietary protocols in their products. Consequently, components from
			different manufacturers are unable to communicate effectively. This issue is rather serious as
			it prevents the mixing and matching of BBUs and RRUs, thereby undermining the effectiveness of
			the entire C-RAN architecture.</span>
	
	&lt;meme&gt;&lt;/meme&gt;
	<h3 id="The-solution" data-id="The-solution" data-svelte-h="svelte-zm55u3"><span>The solution?</span></h3> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-uju53r">To address this problem, the O-RAN ALLIANCE has proposed the Open-RAN specification and

And how did they
			managed to seperate BBU and RRU? Well, O-RAN splits the component bases on their function in
			RAN. This is called

		<span data-svelte-h="svelte-1amg272">As you can see from the above demostration, 5G splits RRU and BBU down into 3 parts, RU, DU
			and CU. Where DU and CU are software that runs in servers and RU is the radio hardware the
			send the receive signals. The different option for spliting up functions into these component
			each have its upsides and downsides and can all be use in various environment depends on its
			sepcific needs. (The splits option 7.2, however, is the one chosen by the O-RAN Alliances)</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-gpfx6v">As demonstrated above, 5G divides the functionality of RRU and BBU into three distinct parts:
			Radio Unit(RU), Distributed Unit(DU), and Centralized Unit(CU). In this architecture, the DU
			and CU are software components that run on servers, while the RU consists of the radio
			hardware responsible for transmitting and receiving signals. Each option for splitting up
			functions into these components has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the suitability
			of each can vary depending on specific environmental needs. Notebly, the splits option 7.2, is
			the one chosen by the O-RAN Alliances, thus becoming a popular choice within the industry.</span> <h2 id="A-Bridge-from-O-RAN-to-its-security-concern-and-into-PTP" data-id="A-Bridge-from-O-RAN-to-its-security-concern-and-into-PTP" data-svelte-h="svelte-i1tbvl"><span>A Bridge from O-RAN to its security concern, and into PTP.</span></h2> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-86oz3c">Now that we understand the structure of O-RAN, there&#39;s still one important aspect to
			consider: the need for precise time alignment in 5G networks. Ensuring accurate time alignment
			among RU, DU, CU and 5G devices is crucial for optimal operation. This is where Precision Time
			Protocol(PTP) comes into play. PTP enables accurate time synchronization throughout a computer
			network, ensuring that all components of the network are precisely aligned in time.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-ea0hqp">However, if time alignment fails to work properly, it can render 5G out of function.
			Cyberattacks can be employed by hackers to disrupt the process of time synchronization, posing
			a significant security threat to 5G users.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-uzv6mb">To understand such concerns, it&#39;s essential to first examine how PTP operates and how

			It&#39;s clear that even a minor discrepancy in timing can result in substantial financial losses.

			devices. By employing the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA), a PTP network determines the
			hierarchy of clocks in the network. It removes redundant connections and organizes the entire
			network into a hierarchical structure resembling &quot;a tree.&quot; This simplifies time
			synchronization, as circular configurations are avoided. Within such a network, a single
			device is designated as the grandmaster (GM), responsible for controlling precise time. Other
			devices receive time messages from the GM.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-k44b5h">Through the exchange of several messages among the clocks in all devices, the entire network

			with other clocks.</span> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-thqkcb">In a network comprised of two nodes connected by a single edge, the master clock serves as
			the time reference, while the slave clock receives time messages from its master. A slave-only
			clock continuously functions as a slave clock, being as a leaf of a tree. Conversely, the
			grandmaster represents the entire PTP network and is always a master, responsible for

If
			a message is deliberately modified by a third party, or if unwanted incorrect messages are
			generated, a PTP network may fail to maintain its accuracy. It is crucial to remain vigilant
			against such attacks to prevent our digital devices from falling prey to them. In the
			following section, we will introduce some common PTP attacks and share tips on how to avoid
			them.</span> <h3 id="PTP-attack-types" data-id="PTP-attack-types" data-svelte-h="svelte-vwel23"><span>PTP attack types</span></h3> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-7g2isv">A simple way to classify PTP attack types is to separate them into internal ones and external
			ones.</span> <h4 id="Internal-PTP-attack" data-id="Internal-PTP-attack" data-svelte-h="svelte-1i15is3"><span>Internal PTP attack</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1d9u3wt">As for internal PTP attacks, attackers can be classified into two levels based on their
			abilities and their access to a device.</span> <h5 id="Simple-attacks" data-id="Simple-attacks" data-svelte-h="svelte-3qw29r"><span>Simple attacks</span></h5> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-19of0lj">This level of attackers operates within a trusted network, either through a secretly-added
			untrusted device or a legitimate trusted device, but WITHOUT having access to cryptographic
			keys. Some attacking movements at this level include packet removal, packet delaying, traffic
			generation and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</span> <h5 id="Advanced-attacks" data-id="Advanced-attacks" data-svelte-h="svelte-9vjqmf"><span>Advanced attacks</span></h5> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1hvqv7b">The advanced attackers, who gain FULL access to a device, including access to
			encryption/authentication keys through malware infection or manipulated firmware upgrades, are
			capable of controlling the device&#39;s behavior or configuration. They can alter clock properties
			or manipulate packet content in transit to deceive the BMCA and disrupt the time exchange
			process. Additionally, they have the capability to generate new legitimate-looking packets to
			disrupt accurate time alignment.</span> <h4 id="External-PTP-attacks" data-id="External-PTP-attacks" data-svelte-h="svelte-y8bu7r"><span>External PTP attacks</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-14auo6s">External PTP attackers operate from outside the trusted network and do not have access to
			secret network encryption or authentication keys. These attackers may attempt to disrupt the
			time synchronization process by exploiting vulnerabilities of devices or connections in the
			network. Their lack of access to cryptographic keys does not hinder their ability to target
			the network, as they employ various techniques to intercept, generate or modify PTP packets,
			thus disrupting time synchronization process.</span> <h3 id="PTP-attacker-types" data-id="PTP-attacker-types" data-svelte-h="svelte-kodhck"><span>PTP attacker types</span></h3> <h4 id="Man-in-the-middle-attacker" data-id="Man-in-the-middle-attacker" data-svelte-h="svelte-pt99iq"><span>Man-in-the-middle attacker</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-38bwr">A man-in-the-middle attacker focuses on intercepting and manipulating messages within a PTP
			network. This attacker can intercept and modify PTP packets while they are in transit. They
			typically achieve this by gaining physical access to a node within the network or by gaining
			full control of a device within the network.</span> <h4 id="Packet-injector-attacker" data-id="Packet-injector-attacker" data-svelte-h="svelte-1ol7sck"><span>Packet injector attacker</span></h4> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1o930bi">A packet injector attacker disrupts the time exchange system by flooding the network with
			excessive network traffic. Despite having limited attack capabilities in an untrusted network,
			it can still render a PTP network out of function by overwhelming it with a high volume of
			packets, causing congestion and hindering the synchronization process.</span> <h3 id="Attacking-scenario" data-id="Attacking-scenario" data-svelte-h="svelte-k4plau"><span>Attacking scenario</span></h3> <span data-svelte-h="svelte-1lr2sa9">Below is an interactive computer network where you can experiment with adding various
			attackers to examine their abilities to disrupt the network.</span>

			engineers, there are steps we can take to protect ourselves. Installing a firewall, exercising
			caution with suspicious emails or links, and avoiding visiting abnormal websites are all
			measures that can help prevent potential invasions by PTP attackers. By taking these
			precautions, we can safeguard ourselves and lower the risk of financial loss, especially when
			engaging in activities such as stock speculation. Ultimately, these measures allow us to fully
			enjoy the convenience brought by 5G technology!</span>
