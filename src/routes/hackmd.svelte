We chat with others, watch various videos or even purchase items online. People do almost anything on the Internet! That is, it is crucial for us to understand how the digital world works. To this end, we create this website to give an overview of O-RAN and PTP(Precision Time Protocol), which is related to 5G technology.</span><h2 id="What-exactly-is-RAN" data-id="What-exactly-is-RAN"><span>What exactly is RAN?</span></h2><span>RAN or Radio Access Network is one of the major component of the mobile data network. It is responsible for connecting User Equipments (UE) with the Central Network (CN) wirelessly.</span>
    <span>(Pic)</span>
    <span><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Radio Access Netowrok">RAN</span> can be devided into 2 different parts:</span>
    <span>1.Baseband Unit (BBU):</span>
    <span>"Baseband" refers to a range of frequency used by signals not yet processed by other components. BBU is responsible for processing and managing baseband signals.</span>
    <span>2. Remote Radio Unit (RRU)</span>
    <span>This unit is also referred to as Remote Radio Head (RRH), it is responsible for transmitting and receiving wireless signal to connect wireless devices with the network.</span>
    <span>These 2 components communicate with each other via optical fiber or simply a electrical wire. The interface of such connection is called CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface). You can think of it as the USB port on various devices.</span>&lt;pic&gt;<span>a interactive image of the whole structure of RAN station where it shows a animation of data being transfer from UE to the central network. and when you click on a part it stands out and shows its name</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<span>The basic structure of a mobile network is that of cellular network, where land areas are divided into </span><em><span>cells</span></em><span> and is served by one or more base station.</span>&lt;pic&gt;<span> cellular network graph</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<h2 id="Okay-so-like…-what-is-5G" data-id="Okay-so-like…-what-is-5G"><span>Okay so like</span><span class="smartypants">…</span><span> what is 5G?</span></h2>&lt;meme&gt;<span> </span>&lt;/meme&gt;
    <span>Fifth-Generation technology standard for cellular networks or 5G, as the name imply, is the current technology in telecommunication. Began being deployed in 2019, this technology promises to change the world with its high speed and low latency. But why exactly is it so important? Why is the buzz all about? To answer this, we needs to take a detour to talk about the history of RAN.</span><h3 id="The-history-of-RAN" data-id="The-history-of-RAN"><span>The history of RAN</span></h3><h4 id="0G" data-id="0G"><span>0G</span></h4><span>After WWII. wireless telephone became availble to the general public. 0G is the era before cellular network (Pre-cellular). 0G is different from the earliar closed telephone system because it is available as a commercial service. These phones are usually housed in cars or trucks</span>
    &lt;pic&gt;<span>car phone</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<h4 id="1G" data-id="1G"><span>1G</span></h4><span>This is the first generation of cellular network. First commercially deployed in 1979 by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph in Tokyo. It uses the cellular structure we mention above and is capable of automaticly switching between different base stations. However, it uses anolog signal to transmit and recieve information, which is prone to noise and</span>
    <span>distortion.</span><h4 id="2G" data-id="2G"><span>2G</span></h4><span>One major difference between 2G and 1G is that 2G transmit signal using digital signals, making it the first generation to do so. Some 2G systems also begin to support SMS and simple data transmition. Nowaday, it is being phase out due to its low speed and transmition rate.</span><h4 id="3G" data-id="3G"><span>3G</span></h4><span>3G is characteristiced by the ability to support high speed mobile data. Normally in the range of few hundred kbps. 3G also aims to provide a standardize internet communication protocol, allowing us to browse the internet and access various data from everywhere in the world. Other than that , it also combine wireless communication with the Internet to create a new system capable of handling images musics vedio and web browsing, making it the mobile network we are familiar with today.</span>
    <span>It uses a new technique called CDMA (code division multiple access) to efficiently package data.</span>
    &lt;pic&gt;<span>animation of CDMA</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<h4 id="4G" data-id="4G"><span>4G</span></h4><span>4G is a faster version of 3G with rate of up to 10 times faster than 3G. It achieve this by using a technology called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). It turns high speed signal into multiple parrallel lower speed signal, which effectively increase the efficiency of utilization of frequency spetrum, raising data transmition rate.</span>
    &lt;pic&gt;<span>animation of OFDMA</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<h4 id="5G" data-id="5G"><span>5G</span></h4><span>Finally, we arrive at 5G.</span>
    <span>5G is the newest generation of cellular techonology. In recent years, Internet and our day to day life have been more entangled than ever. Devices such as autonomous vehicles and various IOT appliences are promising to change our life for the better. And as such devices increase in quantity, the latency and speed of 4G are proofing to be insufficient. Therefore the main priority of 5G is to provide even faster and lower latency mobile data service.</span><span>One of the main difference between 5G and 4G is the C-RAN architecture. C-RAN stands for Centralized RAN. The idea behind it is to seperate BBU from RRU in a base station and make BBU shareable between multiple RRU. As opposed to the D-RAN (Distributed-RAN) used in previous generation where RRU and BBU are bundled together at cell site.</span>
    &lt;pic&gt;<span>C-RAN vs D-RAN</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<span>By using C-RAN, 5G is able to lower the cost and increase efficiency by pooling all of the BBU resources together, further more, it allows for running BBU as virtualized software on existing cloud computing services (This is called VRAN) and we are even using machine learning to dynamicly allocate resources to different RRU base on internet traffic (RIC, RAN intelligent Controller).</span>
    &lt;pic&gt;<span>interective component of V-RAN and resource allocation by having a slider to increase a traffic of some places and a cloud to add resources</span><span class="smartypants">…</span>&lt;/pic&gt;<h2 id="This-is-where-O-RAN-comes-in" data-id="This-is-where-O-RAN-comes-in"><span>This is where O-RAN comes in</span></h2><span>As discuss earlier, 5G's C-RAN model makes a lot of the innovation in 5G possible. However, there is a fundemental problems in the actual implementation of such ideas: vendor lock-in.</span>
    &lt;meme&gt;&lt;/meme&gt;<h3 id="Vendor-Lock-In" data-id="Vendor-Lock-In"><span>Vendor Lock-In</span></h3><span>Vendor lock-in occurs because of the communication protocols between different components of the network are not well define and standardized, leading manufacturers to use their own proprietary protocols on their products. Making it impossible for components from different manufacturers to communicate. This problem is very serious, because it prevent us from mixing and matching BBU and RRU, rendering the whole C-RAN architecture uneffective.</span>&lt;meme&gt;&lt;/meme&gt;<h3 id="The-solution" data-id="The-solution"><span>The solution?</span></h3><span>To address this problem, the O-RAN ALLIANCE proposed the Open-RAN specification and started the development of open source software for RAN.</span><h3 id="O-RAN-Specification" data-id="O-RAN-Specification"><span>O-RAN Specification</span></h3><span>But how exactly did the O-RAN specification define the component of RAN? And how did they managed to seperate BBU and RRU? Well, O-RAN splits the component bases on their function in RAN. This is called Functional Splits</span>
    &lt;pic&gt;<span>Interective element of functional split where a slider control the splits option and three component got filled up with function and the difficulty and cost bar changes </span>&lt;/pic&gt;<span>As you can see from the above demostration, 5G splits RRU and BBU down into 3 parts, RU, DU and CU. Where DU and CU are software that runs in servers and RU is the radio hardware the send the receive signals. The different option for spliting up functions into these component each have its upsides and downsides and can all be use in various environment depends on its sepcific needs. (The splits option 7.2, however, is the one chosen by the O-RAN Alliances)</span><h2 id="A-Bridge-from-O-RAN-to-its-security-concern-and-into-PTP" data-id="A-Bridge-from-O-RAN-to-its-security-concern-and-into-PTP"><span>A Bridge from O-RAN to its security concern, and into PTP.</span></h2><span>Now we have known the structure of O-RAN, but there is still one important thing to consider. In order to operate well, 5G requires not only time alignment but also greater accuracy. That is, it's crucial for us to ensure accurate time alignment among RU, DU, CU and 5G devices. That's where PTP(Precision Time Protocol) comes, which allows for accurate time synchronization throughout a computer network.</span><span>However, if such time alignment fails to work properly, 5G will also become out of function. Various cyberattacks can be employed by hackers to disturb the process of time synchronization, which poses a security threat to 5G users.</span><span>To understand such concerns, we should first look at how PTP works, and how attackers can affect the proper work of it.</span><h3 id="PTP-Overview" data-id="PTP-Overview"><span>PTP Overview</span></h3><span>Simply speaking, the precision time protocol(PTP) aims to ensure all digital devices in a single computer network to be at the same time. The protocol is based on a two-way exchange of PTP messages to synchronize timing.</span><h3 id="Firstly-what-is-a-computer-network" data-id="Firstly-what-is-a-computer-network"><span>Firstly, what is a computer network?</span></h3><span>A computer network combines a set of computers, which use digital interconnections to share information with each other.</span><span>(Make a .gif or short video??)</span><span>With these interconnections made up of physical wires, optical technologies, and wireless radio-frequency devices, we can easily and swiftly exchange messages with people far away from us. When an event happens in the USA, people living in Japan can be immediately informed.</span><h3 id="The-Importance-of-Time-Accuracy" data-id="The-Importance-of-Time-Accuracy"><span>The Importance of Time Accuracy</span></h3><span>Firstly, let's look at an example. Imagine you are in the stock market , and you are trying to complete an transation through a computer. It is crutial that the computer responsible for trading and your computer be syncronized in time. Otherwise it may be buying the stock at a wrong time resulting in a diffrence in stock pricese, leading to a great loss. How terrible it is!</span><span>Now, we have known the significance of time accuracy. Let's delve deeper into this crucial protocol!</span><h2 id="How-PTP-works" data-id="How-PTP-works"><span>How PTP works</span></h2><span>Looking at a computer network, one is comprised of several nodes and there are edges(connections) between these nodes(devices). Using </span><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>BMC Algorithm</span></a><span>, a PTP network will remove some redundant connections and make the entire network "a tree" for simpler time synchronization. In the network, only one device will control the precise time, which is called a Grand Master(GM), while others receive time messages from the GM. By exchanging several messages among clocks in all the devices, the whole network can achieve clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range.</span><span>(Another short video displaying a computer network changing from a graph to a tree.)</span><ul>
